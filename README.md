# Chaintools is the new rebranded Validator blockchain service for decentralised blockchains. 

# This is the front end for the new website which is maintained by Highlander and Simon from Ql3lk.

# The website will be a hub for keen learners who want to come and onboard with ease in to Cosmos. We will show you how to Stake and support the networks that we validate in return you gain knowledge from us. 

# We will support the chains we validate by offering Snapshot services, statesync services and operate Relayers which are intergral to IBC.
